I'd suggest to subscribe to all these channels and binge watch all the videos. There aren't many, in case you're wondering. This should make your concepts clearer than before.

Premium Resources:
There are two courses with comprehensive coverage on this area:

1) Grokking the Object Oriented Design interview [$31, yearly subscription]
This is priced at a hefty tag of $31 as a yearly subscription (in some countries it is even higher). I purchased this course when it was available at a $80 subscription for lifetime access. This was the only resource for dedicated interview preparation for the Object Oriented Design interview some time back. However, in my opinion, the contents of the course doesn’t justify the pricing. The course explains all the UML diagrams, however, in interviews, the interviewer is mostly concerned about the class diagram, if at all. Execution is good, and is in java. However, there are problems in which the core logic is not executed. Apart from that, there is a concept of forums where you can ask doubts in case you’re stuck, but that's just for namesake. My recommendation is to go for this, if you can afford the fee easily.

2) Low Level Design: An interview perspective[$10 or lower, lifetime access]
This is a great course. It was published only a few weeks back, and is priced at ~$10 for lifetime. If you’re from a developing/underdeveloped country, the price is even lower(~$5). The material suits beginners(freshers) and appeals to the experienced as well. I purchased this course a few days before my interview with Amazon, because Amazon frequently asks to design the Splitwise application using OOD. However, I’ve been through the other videos of this course as well, and found them very interesting. Though the content is in C++, I think you’d hardly notice a difference. Besides, this comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, so you can get the money back if you’re not satisfied. Instructor is also active in Q&A section. I got a reject from Flipkart in the OOD round, and messaged him privately for guidance, he gave a detailed explanation for the thought process and the reason for rejection. I highly recommend this course for interview preparation. Here’s a link to the course: https://rb.gy/vnwb37
