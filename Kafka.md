# Kafka

### Kafka Architecture

- Kafka is used for real-time streams of data, to collect big data or to do real time analysis.   
- Kafka is used with in-memory microservices to provide durability and it can be used to feed events to CEP.   
- Kafka has higher throughput, reliability and replication characteristics.   
- Kafka is used most often for streaming data in real-time into other systems.
- Kafka records are immutable   
-  A broker is a Kafka server that runs in a Kafka cluster. Kafka brokers form a cluster. The Kafka cluster consists of many Kafka brokers on many servers. Broker sometimes refer to more of a logical system or as Kafka as a whole.
- Kafka uses Zookeeper to manage the cluster. Zookeeper is used to coordinate the broker/cluster topology.   
- Zookeeper is used for leadership elections for broker topic partition leaders.
